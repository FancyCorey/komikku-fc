## Before You Install

The repository contains work for the next Komikku FC release. The latest
published APK may not include every feature visible in the current source or
development screenshots. Check the notes attached to a release before
installing it.

Komikku FC does not host manga or include content sources. Users choose and
manage compatible source extensions themselves.

## What Komikku FC Adds

- **For You:** personal recommendations based on your ratings, filters, and
  selected sources.
- **Ratings and versions:** Love, Like, Dislike, or mark a manga Not
  interested, then manage matching versions from other sources.
- **Source tools:** evaluate source suitability, compare versions, and find
  sources that may fit your preferences.
- **Local tracking:** keep reading status and progress on the device without
  requiring an external tracking account.
- **Reader tools:** configurable reading modes, timers, schedules, and
  continuity options.

These additions sit alongside Komikku's library, downloads, local reading,
categories, themes, backups, updates, and supported external trackers.

## Core Functionality

The [visual guide](./docs/kmk/visual-guide/README.md) includes more screenshots
and walkthroughs. These examples introduce three main Komikku FC workflows:

| For You recommendations | Compare manga versions | Reading schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Get Started

Browse the [user guide](./docs/kmk/user-guide.md) for instructions or the
[feature guides](./docs/kmk/feature-guides/README.md) for a closer look at individual tools.

1. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/FancyCorey/komikku-fc/releases/latest).
2. Read its compatibility, signing, and update notes.
3. Download the APK intended for your device.
4. Back up your existing library before replacing or migrating an installation.

## Keeping Up to Date

Use **More > About > Check for updates** to look for a newer published release.
Background checks need network access, and update notifications need Android
notification permission. Keep the same public installation when updating;
development builds are separate apps. See the [release notes](./docs/kmk/release-notes.md#app-updates)
for update compatibility details.

## Help and Bug Reports

The general [Komikku FAQ](https://komikku-app.github.io/docs/faq/general) is
still useful for shared reader behavior. For a Komikku FC problem, search this
repository's [open issues](https://github.com/FancyCorey/komikku-fc/issues)
and [release notes](https://github.com/FancyCorey/komikku-fc/releases) first.

When reporting a bug, include:

- the app version from **More > About > Version**;
- clear steps that reproduce the problem;
- what you expected and what happened instead; and
- a screenshot or crash log when it helps explain the issue.
