- [Release notes](release-notes.md) summarizes the current public feature set and compatibility boundary.
- [Technical reference](technical-reference/README.md) explains the XML files used to map features and screenshots.
- [Feature reference (XML)](technical-reference/feature-reference.xml) lists routes, states, privacy rules, and implementation owners in a machine-readable form.

- [Security policy](../../SECURITY.md) explains how to report a vulnerability without publishing sensitive information.

## How the documentation is organized

The `feature-guides/` directory contains task-oriented explanations of Komikku FC's user-facing capabilities. Each page explains the problem being solved, the normal workflow, important states and limits, privacy behavior, and the source files that implement it. The `visual-guide/` directory provides a guided tour of the main screens. The `technical-reference/` directory contains XML indexes for maintainers and automated checks.

Feature pages have short filenames, such as `ratings.md`, `versions.md`, and `backups.md`.

## Design principles

- Library, Browse, Reader, Settings, backup, tracking, and extension features continue to use Komikku's existing screens and internal flows.
- Komikku FC keeps one extension failure from breaking unrelated screens and saves data through Komikku's existing database and settings.
- Cancellation remains cancellation. A source, network, or extension failure is isolated to the operation that encountered it.
- Evaluation Mode changes visible names in screenshots; it does not change saved identifiers, user data, source requests, or the item an action affects.
- Reversible actions record the previous value before a change and keep that record only when the change succeeds.
- The public fork uses its own package name, launcher name, update source, release page, and issue tracker while keeping the original Komikku artwork.

## Screenshots and privacy

The visual guide includes discovery, settings, source-quality, cross-source matching, and Best Version workflows. Evaluation Mode replaces source names with neutral labels while leaving the manga artwork and feature result understandable. Feature guides provide written steps for workflows that depend on personal preferences, reading history, account information, page content, or device configuration.
