/**
 * Pure, stateless policy that determines whether a localized manga candidate is eligible
 * for display in a personalized recommendation flow.
 *
 * This policy is used by For You (BrowsePersonalRecommendationsScreenModel) so that flow
 * applies the same user-controlled visibility rules as the rest of the recommendations system.
 * // KMK v0.7.43: group-seeded recommendations moved to the row-based RecommendsScreenModel
 * // pipeline, which — like the single-manga Recommendations page it now shares — does not run
 * // candidates through this heavier policy; it only excludes exact seed members (see
 * // RecommendsScreenModel's `seed.memberKeys` filter).
 *
 * The policy does NOT perform network or database work. All context data (tasteByKey,
 * knownIds, etc.) must be pre-loaded by the caller and passed explicitly.
 *
 * Evaluation order mirrors For You's existing filter pipeline:
 *   1. Seed member (group-specific; always excluded regardless of other rules).
 *   2. Favorite (library membership).
 *   3. Rated visibility setting (HIDE_ALL_RATED / HIDE_DISLIKED_ONLY / SHOW_ALL_RATED).
 *   4. Seen (user explicitly suppressed the candidate via swipe/dismiss).
 *   5. Known (in user's library or history, when hide-known-manga is enabled).
 *   6. Min-chapter count (when enabled and a local lookup returned a count for the candidate).
