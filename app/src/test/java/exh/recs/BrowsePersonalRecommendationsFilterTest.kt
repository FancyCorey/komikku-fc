/**
 * Tests for [filterVisibleCandidates], the shared pure filter seam used by both the live
 * page-one path and the extra-page discovery path in [BrowsePersonalRecommendationsScreenModel].
 *
 * Regression coverage for the v0.7.41 follow-up: `discoverAdditionalPage()` previously called
 * [RecommendationCandidateVisibilityPolicy] with `knownIds = emptySet()`, so a known-only extra
 * page could be recorded as successful/visible in discovery progress and candidate memory before
 * the final merge silently dropped it. Both call sites now go through this one function with the
 * real hide-known context, so a known candidate is excluded before scoring/progress/memory —
 * not just at merge time.
 *
 * Run with: ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*.BrowsePersonalRecommendationsFilterTest"
