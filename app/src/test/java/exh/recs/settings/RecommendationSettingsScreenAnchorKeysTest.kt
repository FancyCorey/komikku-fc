/**
 * Contract test for the static `item(key = ...)` identifiers each Recommendation Settings screen
 * declares in its `LazyColumn` — the same identifiers `RecommendationSettingsSearchScreen`'s search
 * entries use as [RecommendationSettingsSearchIndex.Entry.anchor] values. Compose UI testing isn't
 * available in this project (no Robolectric/instrumented test infrastructure), so this can't drive
 * the real screens; instead it hardcodes the same key lists the screens declare (kept in sync
 * manually — each screen file cross-references this test in its own comments) and asserts the one
 * property that would otherwise only surface as a runtime Compose crash: LazyColumn item keys must
 * be unique within a single screen, or ambiguous scroll targets and recomposition bugs result.
 *
 * If a screen's real item list ever diverges from what's listed here, the fix is to update this
 * test's list to match the screen, not to "make the test pass" some other way — this is a regression
 * guard against a copy/paste anchor conflict within one screen, not a source of truth.
 *
 * KMK v0.8.14: `RecommendationForYouSettingsScreen` and `RecommendationMatchingVersionsSettingsScreen`
 * were retired as top-level destinations (and deleted as files -- their controls all moved to
 * `RecommendationTasteTagsSettingsScreen`/`RecommendationDiagnosticsSettingsScreen`), so their
 * dedicated key lists/tests were removed rather than kept as dead placeholders. Every former key of
 * theirs is still covered below, just merged into the screen that now owns it.
 *
 * KMK v0.8.14-fix1: `RecommendationSourcePrioritySettingsScreen` (renamed "For You sources") lost its
 * language keys -- `LanguageSelectorContent` moved to `RecommendationDiagnosticsSettingsScreen`
 * (renamed `source_languages_header`/`source_languages_content` -> `recommendation_languages_header`/
 * `recommendation_languages_content`). The preview action moved from the bottom to the top of the
 * source screen (`preview_for_you` is now the first key). Source Evaluation gained
 * The pre-run outdated-source disclosure was later removed; excluded rows use the neutral row
 * state instead.
